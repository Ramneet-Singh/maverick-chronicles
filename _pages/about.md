Hi there! I'm Ramneet, a Junior Undergraduate in the [CSE Department](https://cse.iitd.ac.in) at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in). I maintain a [personal website](https://ramneet-singh.netlify.app) where you can read about me, my academic background, my work experience and achievements. It also contains a listing of some of my projects along with associated slides, github links and so on. I encourage you to go check it out!

As for this blog, I intend to write about computer science and programming. I am on the (long) journey of becoming a better programmer day by day. This will be a medium for me to write about what I'm learning. I plan to write summaries of interesting research papers I read, and about CS topics that fascinate me. Though this list is ever expanding, for now that means I want to write about programming languages, compilers and program synthesis.
