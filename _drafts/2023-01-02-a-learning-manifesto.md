I have always believed that my focus while doing courses (and any other thing) should be on learning as well as I can. However, like any other principle, reality has often reared its ugly head and challenged this belief. I have to, much more often than I'd like, think about my marks and grades. They are one of the measurable outcomes by which everyone else (including potential graduate schools and employers) will judge me. Hence, I feel tempted to shift my focus from learning to optimising my grades.

My naive freshman self was aware of this temptation and confident that I would learn to deal with it by the end of my first year. Yet, a day before the final  examinations for my seventh semester, I found myself in a state of anxiety, dreading the ordeal that was about to follow. Sure enough, before each exam, I revised my notes in constant fear, sometimes pulled all-nighters to "finish" the syllabus. I decided then that I'd had enough. I'm old and wise now (*lol*), there must be a better way to approach exams, and the semester in general.

I am now beginning the second half of my fourth year, and if I had conquered the temptation, I perhaps wouldn't need to write this post.
